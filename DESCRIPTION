Description: SimRepeat generates correlated systems of statistical equations which represent 
    repeated measurements or clustered data.  These systems contain either: a) continuous normal, 
    non-normal, and mixture variables based on the techniques of Headrick and Beasley (2004) 
    <DOI:10.1081/SAC-120028431> or b) continuous (normal, non-normal and mixture), ordinal, 
    and count (regular or zero-inflated, Poisson and Negative Binomial) variables based on the 
    hierarchical linear models (HLM) approach.  Headrick and Beasley's method for continuous 
    variables calculates the beta (slope) coefficients based on the target correlations between 
    independent variables and between outcomes and independent variables.  The package provides 
    functions to calculate the expected correlations between outcomes, between outcomes and error 
    terms, and between outcomes and independent variables, extending Headrick and Beasley's 
    equations to include mixture variables.  These theoretical values can be compared to the 
    simulated correlations.  The HLM approach requires specification of the beta coefficients, 
    but permits group and subject-level independent variables, interactions among independent 
    variables, and fixed and random effects, providing more flexibility in the system of 
    equations.  Both methods permit simulation of data sets that mimic real-world clinical or 
    genetic data sets (i.e. plasmodes, as in Vaughan et al., 2009, <10.1016/j.csda.2008.02.032>).  
    The techniques extend those found in the SimMultiCorrData and SimCorrMix packages.  
    Standard normal variables with an imposed intermediate correlation matrix are transformed 
    to generate the desired distributions.  Continuous variables are simulated using either 
    Fleishman's third-order (<DOI:10.1007/BF02293811>) or Headrick's fifth-order 
    (<DOI:10.1016/S0167-9473(02)00072-5>) power method transformation (PMT).  Simulation 
    occurs at the component-level for continuous mixture distributions.  These components are 
    transformed into the desired mixture variables using random multinomial variables based on 
    the mixing probabilities.  The target correlation matrices are specified in terms of 
    correlations with components of continuous mixture variables.  Binary and ordinal variables 
    are simulated using a modification of GenOrd's ordsample function.  Count variables are 
    simulated using the inverse CDF method.  There are two simulation pathways for the 
    multi-variable type systems which differ by intermediate correlations involving count 
    variables.  Correlation Method 1 adapts Yahav and Shmueli's 2012 method 
    (<DOI:10.1002/asmb.901>).  Correlation Method 2 adapts Barbiero and Ferrari's 2015 
    modification of GenOrd (<DOI:10.1002/asmb.2072>).  The optional error loop may be used 
    to improve the accuracy of the final correlation matrices.  The package also provides 
    function to check parameter inputs and summarize the generated systems of equations.
